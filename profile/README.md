## GESTURA - Sign Translator

Despite this significant demographic, deaf individuals face substantial challenges in communication. A major issue is the lack of effective communication, which often results in discrimination and limited opportunities in social and professional settings. The cause of this challenge lies in the communication barrier between hearing and deaf individuals. While those with hearing impairments rely on sign language, most people lack familiarity with it. One of the key reasons for this barrier is the insufficient recognition of sign language as an important means of communication. Many people are unaware of its significance, and efforts to make it more accessible remain inadequate. As a result, the primary problem is the limited availability of accessible and user-friendly learning resources for sign language.
/n
Gestura is developed to solve this problem. Gestura itself is an AI-Powered Mobile Application for Sign Language Translation and Education. The goal from this app is to promote and share sign language knowledge for communicating with deaf individuals, reducing communication barriers and raising equality.
/n
Machine Learning : Preprocess image data to put landmarks on users hand. Then this landmarks coordinates used to train machine learning model. The model built with Tensorflow, while the landmarks generated by Mediapipe.
/n
Mobile Development : Make a simple user interface from this application and integrated all requirements features with Kotlin and Android Studio
Cloud Computing : Create and Design environment to make request and response from user for translate sign video or text to machine learning model. Then deploying this API on Google Cloud Run and storing gesture assets in Google Cloud Storage.
